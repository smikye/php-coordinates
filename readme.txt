For using DurationScoreService you can call its static method calculateDurationScore and pass there two arrays with coordinates. Optionally you can pass time calculation algorithm id and score calculation method id. For the choosing of time calculation algorithm and score calculation method I used Strategy pattern. So, for adding new method or algorithm you need to create a class which will implement ScoreCalculationMethod Interface or TimeCalculationAlgorithm Interface and add it to the ScoreCalculationMethodFactory or TimeCalculationAlgorithmFactory. There could be some difference between distances from Google API and Straight method, because straight method calculates distance directly from point to point and Google API returns distance by roads. Tags for each method/algorithm you can find in Factories.
